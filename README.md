# My personal toolbox for javascript

I created this toolbox in order to have a collection of useful bits of code
for my future everyday work with javascript.

This toolbox contains mostly commented JavaScript-files, which you can e.g. directly
execute in an IDE such as IntellJ IDEA very easily and very fast, so you 
can change the code and instantly rerun it and see it's effects.

This toolbox contains also some links to other resources I found valuable 
for my work.
