/**
 * Be careful: "this", "class" and "instanceof" (among others) work quite differently than in some other programming
 * languages such as Java.
 *
 * This document is not here to teach the exact specifics and the exact differences. Instead, this document is
 * here to remind you to take great care in these regards. And to point you to some resources, where you can learn
 * more about the respective subjects:
 *
 *
 * INSTANCEOF:
 * This is completely different than in Java: It basically just looks, whether it appears somewhere in the
 * prototype-chain.
 *
 * For some practical examples and more explanations, see:
 * -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof
 *
 *
 * CLASS:
 * Because JavaScript is more a functional than an object oriented language, the class construction is a relatively
 * new concept for JavaScript and is in its root not comparable with a class in Java.
 *
 * As pointed out by the following docs, classes are in fact "special functions".
 * To further enhance your understanding, please visit:
 * -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes
 *
 *
 * THIS:
 * Be very careful with this one, because 'this' will often not point to the object you think it would.
 * Hint: get very familiar with the JavaScript way of handling 'this'!
 *
